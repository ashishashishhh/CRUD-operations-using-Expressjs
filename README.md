# CRUD-operations-using-Expressjs
Implementing CRUD operations using Expressjs and Postman
 STEP 1: First we need to create a packet.json file in the folder.
 
 STEP 2: Then we have to install Express Js using the command -- npm install express
 
 STEP 3: Then we will create an index.js file in which we are going to write
our javascript code for the operations.

STEP 4: We will create one more file (data.js) in which we will store a dummy
data so that we can use it as the API and perform operations on that.

STEP 5: Then in the index.js file we have to import express and the data file
so that we can use it.Then we will run it on a local host.

STEP 6: Now we can do GET PUT DELETE AND UPDATE operations using Postman
